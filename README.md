### 👨‍💻 About Me 

Computer science student with passion for ML Systems and AI. Currently in my 1st year of Master's degree. I work as as a machine learning engineer @ 🤗 Huggingface, where I help to maintain and contribute to [Accelerate](https://github.com/huggingface/accelerate). When I'm not working I'm one of the main contributors to [KernelBot](https://github.com/gpu-mode/discord-cluster-manager).

- :telescope: I'm interested in all things related to AI and ML

- :brain: I love to understand things in depth and learn about how the underlying HW works

- :seedling: My current focus in on understanding the internals of GPUs and distributed communication

- :books: I spend most of my free time learning new stuff which I currently obsess over
